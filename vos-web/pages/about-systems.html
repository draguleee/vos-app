          <h3> ...What is a System? </h3>
          <p>
            <br> A system represents an ensemble of elements that have a global purpose. 
            Between these elements, there are common actions, interactions and 
            interdependencies. Each and every element has its own behaviour, and 
            those behaviors describe the system overall. <br><br>
            To better understand the concept of system (if you are new to those 
            terminologies), imagine a bicycle: a bicycle represents an ensemble of 
            elements (wheels, brakes, handle bar, seat, chain, pedals etc), that 
            have a global purpose: to allow its "user" to travel to certain locations. <br><br>
            Between the listed elements, there are common actions, interactions and
            interdependencies, such as:
            <br> - When the pedals are pushed, the wheels start moving;
            <br> - When the brake is actioned, the wheels are stopped;
            <br> - When the wheels are in movement, the chain is rotating too. 
            This is only a simple example of a system, but there are many more systems 
            of many more types.

          <h3> ...Types of systems </h3>
          <p>
            <br> Systems can be classified as continuous, discrete-time, discrete-event, hybrid, control etc.
            When one or more of the system's characteristics change in time, the system is dynamic. 
            The hierarchy that best describes the dynamic systems is described as follows:
            <br> - <b>Dynamic systems:</b> Systems with variable parameters in time, Time invariant systems;
            <br> - <b>Time invariant systems:</b> Nonlinear systems, Linear systems;
            <br> - <b>Linear systems:</b> Continuous state systems, Discrete state systems;
            <br> - <b>Discrete state systems:</b> Time-driven systems, Event-driven systems;
            <br> - <b>Event-driven systems:</b> Deterministic systems, Stochastic systems.
            <br> All of the systems listed above present unique and vaste characteristics, thus we 
            will not talk them through. The one and only system category of interest is <b>Discrete
            events systems</b> category.
            </b>
